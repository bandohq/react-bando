With this Privacy Notice, we ensure that we gather, store, protect and handle Personal Data fairly, transparently and with respect towards individual rights, even after the termination of the contractual relationship with Bando, where applicable.

We take privacy and transparency seriously. We process Personal Data lawfully, fairly, securely and in a transparent manner. We only collect and process Personal Data that is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and we do not further process such Personal Data in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. We keep Personal Data accurate and up to date and keep it in a form which permits identification of Data Subjects for no longer than is necessary. 

This Privacy Notice is issued by Bando, to explain how we process Personal Data before, during and after any contractual relationship with us and in connection with affiliation with us. The Company is the entity that is considered the controller with respect to Personal Data processed by us. 

In this Privacy Notice where we refer to "Bando", "we" or "us", we mean the Company. 

## What data do we collect?

Bando will process certain Personal Data related to Data Subjects. "Personal Data" means any information relating to an individual and processed by us, including any information through which an individual can be identified or identifiable, directly or indirectly, which may include:

- Asset, financial, and tax information such as tax residence, tax returns, bank account data, payment details, public addresses of a Blockchain wallet (public Wallet address), among others.
- Biometric data, which is obtained through a validation process known as a "proof of life," a process verifying that the person providing the information is real and not attempting fraud with techniques such as deepfakes or 3D masks, requiring the User to provide a selfie or perform movements in front of a camera in real-time.
- Any information related to the company the User represents, and
- IP address for accessing the Platform.

## How do we collect Personal Data?

Data Subjects directly provide us with most of their Personal Data we process, through Bandos's website https://bando.cool/ (hereinafter "Platform") as follows: We collect and process Personal Data when someone accesses or uses the Platform ("User") and when they enter into a contractual relationship with us. Sometimes we will obtain Personal Data from alternative sources, including but not limited to: other affiliates and service providers and government bodies where required by law (such as tax authorities). If the requested information is not provided, we may be unable to conduct certain business operations or comply with the applicable legislation. 

Exceptionally, we might process sensitive information and only for limited and strictly defined purposes, such as equal opportunities monitoring and diversity monitoring and initiatives may involve us using race or ethnicity data such as information contained in the passport or other citizenship document.

Bando will not request sensitive personal data from the User that could have an impact on the most intimate aspects of them or that, if misused, could result in discrimination or pose a serious risk. Sensitive data includes racial or ethnic origin, current or future health status, genetic information, religious, philosophical, and moral beliefs, union affiliation, political opinions, and sexual preference, except for biometric data required for certain Users under specific circumstances, as described in the terms of use.

## How will we use Personal Data?

We will process Personal Data for the primary purposes of: 
1. Enabling operations on the Platform
2. Ensuring, where applicable, that Users are the same persons who create an account on the Platform, to prevent fraud and identity theft, and to meet the customer identification (KYC) requirements
3. Using personal data for internal statistical analysis or any other research function that Bando may conduct to continue improving the services it offers on the Platform
4. Carrying out operations on the Platform and identifying, processing, and storing records of all operations performed by the User
5. Sending notifications related to operations, requesting account updates, or relevant information about the Platform and operations performed
6. Complying with applicable legal and tax obligations (as applicable)
7. Conducting internal analyses and statistical studies to improve the Platform and services offered

Where relevant, we will only process Personal Data with an express prior consent of the Data Subjects.

By registering on the Platform with their email and, where applicable, phone number, the User agrees to receive emails, SMS, social media notifications, and notifications through known and future media, in general, any means that Bando may use to send information to the User. The User consents to receiving notifications related to the Platform, including follow-ups on operations performed, temporary suspension of access to the Platform or service, promotions, and information of interest, as well as any other information Bando deems necessary to communicate to the User concerning their legal relationship with the Platform. User agree and consent that Bando may share the User's Personal Data at any time and with any third party for the purpose of customer identification, identity verification (KYC processes) and to prevent and identify users or transactions related to Anti-Money Laundering and for the purposes of combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). This provision applies from the time the User first interacts with Bando and the Platform, and shall remain in full force and effect for as long as Bando is legally obligated to perform periodic reviews regarding regulatory compliance and customer identification.

The User may choose to stop receiving strictly promotional emails and notifications at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in all promotional emails. However, the User may not opt-out of receiving emails or notifications necessary for the correct functioning of the Platform or for the operations carried out by the User on the Platform.

In accordance with applicable law, by accessing and using the Platform and providing Personal Data to Bando, the User consents to the processing of such data under the terms outlined in this Notice.

We store most of Personal Data in our internal systems. We keep some data in a secure Google Cloud Service. Between Bando entities we only grant access to Personal Data on a need-to-know basis, necessary for the purposes for which such access is granted. In some cases, Bando uses third parties located in various countries to collect, use, analyse, and otherwise process Personal Data on its behalf. We tightly control access to the data to only members of the organisation that have a valid reason to access the information. 

We maintain records of processing of Personal Data in accordance with the applicable laws.

Personal Data will be managed and processed according to Bando's general management to meet the primary purposes. However, not all Personal Data will be required from all Users or for all operations on the Platform; data collection depends on various factors, as described herein and in the terms of use of the Platform.

Personal Data will remain part of a database for the duration Bando considers necessary to achieve the purposes mentioned in this Notice and for the corresponding legal periods. After these periods, the Personal Data will be blocked and canceled for subsequent deletion. The blocking period will be equivalent to the prescription period of the legal actions arising from the legal relationship that founded the processing, as per the applicable law.

The User agrees to keep the data provided to Bando updated. The User will be responsible for any damage or harm caused to Bando or third parties as a result of false, inaccurate, outdated, or inauthentic information. Nonetheless, the collection of Personal Data may be limited or expanded depending on the type of operation performed by the User on the Platform, determined case by case.
